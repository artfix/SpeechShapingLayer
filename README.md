# SpeechShapingLayer
Speech Shaping Layer script for Home Assistant

- SpeechShapingLayer script is NOT dependent on the LLM model.
- It will work with any model that accepts plain text and returns plain text.

But let’s break it down properly.

# 🧠 What Script Actually Does
1. Takes a message
2. Converts it into SSML
3. Wraps everything in: ```<speak> ... </speak>```

5. Sends it to:
```
hass.services.call(
    "conversation",
    "process",
    {"text": final_output, "agent_id": agent_id}
)
```

So the LLM is only receiving:
```<speak>...SSML...</speak>```

The AI model is NOT generating the SSML, the script is generating it.


# 🔎 So What Determines Compatibility?

Compatibility depends entirely on:

1️⃣ The Home Assistant conversation integration

and

2️⃣ The agent you selected (agent_id)

Example:
agent_id="conversation.kira_local"

# RuLL: 
The agent must:

- Accept input text

- Return text

- Not break on XML/SSML content

# ✅ Will It Work With:

It will work with ollama

- Ollama models accept raw text

- They don’t reject XML

- They will just treat <speak> as text

The script does NOT require model-side SSML understanding.

# 🚨 Important Detail

The LLM is NOT synthesizing speech.

EdgeTTS (or whatever TTS backend you use) is the one that must support: 
```<prosody>

<break>

<amazon:effect>

<speak>
```
If your TTS supports SSML → you’re fine.

The LLM model does NOT need to support SSML at all.

# 🎯 When Would It NOT Work?

It would break if:

- The model strips XML tags

- The agent sanitizes or escapes XML

- The conversation integration filters ```< >```

- The model tries to "fix" your SSML

Example of breaking behavior:
If the model rewrites:

```<speak>Hello</speak>```


into:

```Sure! <speak>Hello</speak>```


That would corrupt your output.

# ⚠️ Only Avoid

Models that:

- Auto-format output heavily

- Add markdown formatting

- Insert explanations automatically

- Sanitize XML

But most instruct models behave.

# 🧠 Big Clarification

Script is a speech shaping layer.

It does NOT depend on:

- Model intelligence

- Model size

- Model architecture

- Model training data

It only depends on:

- Whether HA conversation agent passes the text through correctly.
